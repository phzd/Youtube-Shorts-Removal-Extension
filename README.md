# Youtube Shorts Removal Extension

This extension gives you a way to remove the shorts button on the side pane of Youtube.
This does not remove shorts from your recommended or search queries.

This was only done so that I wouldn't get lost as easily in the shitstorm that is Youtube Shorts while still allowing me to watch interesting looking videos from their thumbnail.
